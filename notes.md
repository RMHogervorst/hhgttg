# notes
Maybe do some textmining?


files are copied from calibre library to disk, but not shared on github, because that would violate copyright. 


cleaning notes
Extract from text :

- [x] "CHAPTER [number] \n" 
- [x] remove "Unknown\n      Unknown" (or make it chapter end.)
- [x] exclude the part[nr]_split_000.xhtml parts (contain title of book)
- [x] keep only the parts that start with CHAPTER
- [] maybe remove all linebreaks?
